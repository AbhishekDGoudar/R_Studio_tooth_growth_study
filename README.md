Study on the growth of the odontoblast of the incisor teeth as a criterion of vitamin C intake in guinea pigs using Two Way ANOVA

## Problem Statement
A concern during the Second World War was the provision of vitamin C to soldiers, and in this broad context the effects of ascorbic acid and orange juice were studied in animals. One such study was the Cramptonâ€™s study, 60 guinea pigs were given a dietary supplement of vitamin C in one of three doses (0.5, 1 or 2 mg/day) delivered in one of two ways (as ascorbic acid or orange juice).
